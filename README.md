By Anmol Gupta, Annie Hwang, Paul Lisker, and Kevin Loughlin

See https://www.kaggle.com/c/asap-aes for info on data sets.  Particularly note the anonymization techniques, which might make parsing a little more difficult.

data/
- Essay_Set_Descriptions/ gives the basic essay scoring system and methods, prompt, and basic statistics about the essay prompts.
- Scoring_Guides_And_Examples/ provides a tighter breakdown on the scoring system with written examples.  Given the scope of this project, the written examples will almost certainly not be used, but reading through the scoring could give ideas on how to automatically grade an essay more appropriately.
