    "\n",
    "This exercise is designed to help you transform and model textual data. You may find the tutorial [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html) helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to vectorize a small set of twitter data and predict the polarity (a property of the content of tweet) of tweets using KNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load `tweet.csv`, this is a data set containing tweets and their polarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using `CountVectorizer`, turn each tweet into a vector of features. Play with the values for `min_df`, `max_df` and `stop_words`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Get the names of the features you produced, using `get_feature_names`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Split the data set into train and test (make sure there are both types of polarity present in train)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use KNN to predict the polarity of the test tweets. How good is your model? What is the effect of your choice of `min_df`, `max_df` and `stop_words` on your model?"
